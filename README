 for previously declared variables

ast.java
-added buildCrossReferences method to suitable nodes to support the task
 of adding the variable uses and dealing with the correct scoping

symbol_table.java
-structure used to store infos on a variable

Extra credit:
Illegal redeclaration:
- If found redeclared, only displays error and do not delete the first declaration from hash table. Why?
